# TextClassification

A comprehensive text classification project using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. This repository demonstrates the implementation of various classification models and techniques to analyze and predict text data.

---

## Features

- Preprocessing of text data using NLP techniques.
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models for classification.
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
- Easy-to-follow project structure for educational and practical purposes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or later
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdityaKhandelwal2306/TextClassification.git
   cd TextClassification
   ```
2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Prepare your dataset:
   - Ensure your text data is in the appropriate format for preprocessing and modeling.

2. Run the preprocessing scripts:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```

3. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

4. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```
5. Launch the API
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```
6. Make predictions:
   - Postman: Use the POST API to call the endpoint with the route:
     ```
     http://<localhostOrIP>:<port>/predict/
     ```
     Include the following JSON body:
     ```json
     {
       "text": "I love this product, it's amazing!"
     }
     ```
